# GreenLink: Revolutionizing Waste Recycling through Blockchain and Sustainability

## Introduction

GreenLink is a transformative platform for waste recycling, combining blockchain technology, sustainability practices, and advanced data management with **Cherty** and **Poplar Protocol**. Through a decentralized marketplace, GreenLink empowers individuals, organizations, and communities to responsibly manage waste, promoting a circular economy model.

## Overview

GreenLink introduces a decentralized ecosystem for the buying, selling, and exchange of recyclable materials. With **Cherty’s permissioned IPFS** and **Poplar Protocol** as the foundational tools, the platform enhances security, transparency, and efficiency. GreenLink categorizes recyclable items, utilizes zero-knowledge proof verification for privacy, and encourages sustainable waste segregation.

### Key Technologies
- **Cherty**: Provides permissioned IPFS, ensuring secure, traceable, and permission-based data storage for GreenLink.
- **Poplar Protocol**: The underlying framework behind Cherty, facilitating reusable code and data objects to streamline development, data accessibility, and code interoperability.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Marketplace**: Engage in buying, selling, and trading recyclable materials within a permissioned, decentralized network.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification**: Verify user and organization credentials without exposing private data, maintaining security and privacy.
- **Permissioned IPFS Storage**: Cherty enables secure storage for waste data and images with permissions managed via Poplar Protocol.
- **Itemized Recycling Categories**: Easily categorize and manage different types of recyclable items for efficient processing.
- **Token-Based Incentives**: Earn rewards for participating in recycling activities, incentivizing community-driven sustainability.
- **Transparency and Traceability**: Track waste materials throughout the recycling process to ensure accountability across the supply chain.
- **Community Engagement**: Collaborate with others to promote sustainable practices and environmental responsibility.

## Benefits

- **Environmental Conservation**: Minimize landfill waste, reduce pollution, and conserve natural resources.
- **Economic Empowerment**: Create new economic opportunities within the circular economy and recycling industry.
- **Social Impact**: Promote environmental stewardship, foster community engagement, and empower communities to take action.

## Deployment

GreenLink is deployed on multiple blockchain networks to ensure accessibility and interoperability.

## How It Works

1. **Minting Waste Data**: Users upload information about waste materials, which is stored securely using Cherty’s permissioned IPFS. Metadata is managed and categorized on-chain.
2. **Incentivized Recycling**: Users are rewarded through token incentives for recycling activities. All data, including waste type, weight, and collection points, is securely stored and can be accessed by authorized parties.
3. **Data Privacy and Security**: Poplar Protocol enables secure, permission-based access to data objects, ensuring data privacy for users and organizations alike.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- **Node.js** and **npm** installed
- A blockchain wallet such as **MetaMask**
- **Cherty API Key** to connect to Cherty's permissioned IPFS

## Using the Platform

1. **Upload Waste Data**: Navigate to the "Register Waste" section and fill in details about your recyclable items.
2. **Mint as NFT**: Convert your data into a verified, blockchain-based record that can be traded or viewed.
3. **View and Manage Data**: Use the marketplace to manage, trade, or view waste data securely.
